Practica 2

- Run and gather execution time (4 or 5 samples), then draw a graph (with Calc, octave, gnuplot).

- modify the code in github and program the comparison (take more samples).

- upload results to your github account

- write a Makefile for the code, it must contain "all" and "clean"

- Create the loops that the exercises (loop_exercises.cpp) don't implement

- Transform loops in the exercise to ranged loops
